# Waste Management System

## Description

Our waste management system utilizes Circle API to reward users with incentives for recycling a specified number of pet bottles.
By encouraging recycling, we aim to promote a cleaner environment and reduce waste in landfills. Our system provides a simple and efficient way for users to participate in sustainable practices and receive tangible benefits for their efforts.
These incentives can then be used in our marketplace to purchase items as the user may wish.

## Further Improvement

This is the first version of our Project and the following features will be coming implemented in the second version.

- IoT Count: An IoT device for real time counting of the plastics bottles and sending the counts onchain to be used by the priceFeeds for accurate conversion to local and cryptocurrencies.

- Price Feed: Oracles for external computations and price Feeds and value rate conversions will be implemented.
